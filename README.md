# subdomainfinder
To use the subdomain finder tool, you can follow these steps:

Install Python on your computer if you don't already have it installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Copy the code from one of the previous messages and paste it into a text editor of your choice (e.g. Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

Save the file with a .py extension (e.g. subdomain-finder.py).

Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the .py file is located.

Type python subdomain-finder.py (replacing subdomain-finder.py with the name of your file) and press Enter.

The program will prompt you to enter a domain. Enter the domain you want to find subdomains for (e.g. example.com) and press Enter.

The program will then fetch the subdomains of the entered domain and display them on the screen.

Note: Please use this tool responsibly and only on domains you have permission to scan. Some domains may have restrictions on the use of automated tools, so it's important to be aware of any relevant laws and regulations.
